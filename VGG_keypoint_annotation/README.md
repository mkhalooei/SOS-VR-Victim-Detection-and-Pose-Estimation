# Keypoint Detection

This demo uses a model based on convolution neural network to automatically detect 
keypoints in a photograph of a human body.

### Software Dependencies
You need MATLAB to run this demo.

### Running Demo
 1. Download the [latest source code](https://gitlab.com/vggdemo/keypoint_matlab_demo/repository/archive.zip?ref=master) 
and uncompress it.
 2. Move to the directory which contains uncompressed files.
 3. Open a matlab session and issue the following command:
```
$ matlab
> demo
```
This shows the result of running the keypoint detection algorithm on the supploed sample image.
